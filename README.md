If you want to use working signals on your layout or even if you only want to have an operational CTC panel that indicates train locations, you need to have some sort of sensors or block detectors that detect the presence of a train in a particular track section. Unfortunately, such sensors are not cheap and on top of it, require a considerable amount of efforts to identify the best location, install them and then make them work. In this Video I am experimenting with a fresh way of block detection that offers low cost, high resolution and little installation pain.
